# Web Application Security

## Testing methodologies on Web Applications

Testing methodologies on Web Applications ensures that the applications is secure, reliable and functions properly. It is esential to identify issues before the application is seen by users.
### Testing Techniques:

#### 1. Functional testing-

It is a software testing which ensures that the software is functioning and is performing its task accurately. Identifies and solve defects early in development stage.

#### 2. Usability Testing-

This software testing involves real users interaction to identify if their is any issue in the application or not. Helps to identify issues related to navigation, design, content readability.

#### 3.Interface Testing-

Tests the interaction between web server , database server and application server to ensure that the data is flowing correctly.

#### 4.Security Testing-

Ensures that the application is safe from malicious activities by identifying vulnerabilities. Protects the application from attackers.

#### 5. Performance Testing-

Tests the performance of the web application under various conditions such as on different devices or connections. Ensures that the application is stable and responsive.
# DevSecOps
DevSecOps stands for development, security, and operations. It is an approach to build security framework from the start. It reduces risk of security vulnerabilities.

#### Key points:
#### 1. Automatation-

It uses tools to handle security task automatically without any manual support that makes process faster and remove errors. 

#### 2. Security from the Start-

It includes security from the beginning of software development. Identifies vulnerabilities in the planning stage. 

#### 3. Collaboration-

Developers, security and operation teams work together and ensure that the software is safe and runs smoothly. Regulates meetings to update ideas and resolve issues. 

#### 4.Continuous Monitoring-

Keeps eyes on the software and system to detect errors or other issues. Identify problems faster before they become major issues.

#### 5.Clear processes-

Writes clear instructions, step by step works for coding and testing. Establish clear plans for dealing with system failures or other issues. 

# SAST AND DAST

| SAST  | DAST |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Stands for Static Application Security Testing focuses on finding vulnerabilities during the development stage or without executing the code. | Stands for Dynamic Application Security Testing, this simulates attackes during the working stage to test the running application.|
| It is White Box Security Testing which represents developer approach.| It is Black Box Security Testing which represents hacker approach.|
| Cheaper as it finds error during the development stages. | Expensive to fix vulnerabilities.|

### SAST Tools:
 1. Checkmarx
 2. Spectral
 3. Veracode
 4. JIT
### DAST Tools:
 1. OWASP Top 10
 2. Burpsuite
 3. Acunetix

# Securing web applications efficiently

#### Set up authentication and access control
Enforcing strong password. Adding extra layer of security.
#### Secure coding practices
Sanitizing code to avoid input of malicious code in the software.
#### Secure Data transmission
It means that the data is transferred in a way such that the data is not accessed or modified by any other unauthorized person.
#### Conduct regular security testing
Testing code in the running stage and analyzing code for vulnerabilities.
#### Backup regularly
Backing up saves the files and important data from being crash or any other failure.
